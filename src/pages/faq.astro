      Common questions about Knowledge That Compounds and our consulting services.

      <!-- Question 1 -->
      <details class="bg-white border-2 border-gray-200 rounded-lg p-6 cursor-pointer hover:border-blue-500 transition-all shadow-sm hover:shadow-md">
        <summary class="text-xl font-semibold text-gray-900 cursor-pointer">
          What is Knowledge That Compounds (KTC)?
        </summary>
        <div class="mt-4 text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
          <p class="mb-3">
            KTC is a methodology for building AI systems with persistent memory. Instead of every conversation 
            starting from zero, knowledge accumulates and compounds over time through specialized "Brains."
          </p>
          <p>
            Think of it as creating a team of AI assistants that remember everything, share knowledge 
            intelligently, and improve with every interaction.

      <!-- Question 2 -->
      <details class="bg-white border-2 border-gray-200 rounded-lg p-6 cursor-pointer hover:border-blue-500 transition-all shadow-sm hover:shadow-md">
        <summary class="text-xl font-semibold text-gray-900 cursor-pointer">
          How is this different from just using ChatGPT?
        </summary>
        <div class="mt-4 text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
          <p class="mb-3">
            Standard AI tools like ChatGPT have no persistent memory. Every conversation starts fresh, 
            context disappears between sessions, and you constantly repeat yourself.
          </p>
          <p>
            KTC builds systems where knowledge persists, accumulates, and routes to the right Brain. 
            It's the difference between having a brilliant colleague with amnesia versus one with perfect memory.

      <!-- Question 3 -->
      <details class="bg-white border-2 border-gray-200 rounded-lg p-6 cursor-pointer hover:border-blue-500 transition-all shadow-sm hover:shadow-md">
        <summary class="text-xl font-semibold text-gray-900 cursor-pointer">
          What is a "Brain" in the KTC system?
        </summary>
        <div class="mt-4 text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
          <p class="mb-3">
            A Brain is a specialized AI assistant with persistent memory for a specific domain. For example:
          </p>
          <ul class="list-disc list-inside space-y-2 ml-4 text-gray-700">
            <li>Marketing Brain: Remembers campaign strategies, brand voice, past results</li>
            <li>Research Brain: Accumulates findings, sources, insights over time</li>
            <li>Operations Brain: Tracks processes, decisions, team workflows</li>
          </ul>
          <p class="mt-3">
            Each Brain maintains context, learns from interactions, and shares knowledge with other Brains when needed.
          </p>
        </div>

      <!-- Question 4 -->
      <details class="bg-white border-2 border-gray-200 rounded-lg p-6 cursor-pointer hover:border-blue-500 transition-all shadow-sm hover:shadow-md">
        <summary class="text-xl font-semibold text-gray-900 cursor-pointer">
          How long does implementation take?
        </summary>
        <div class="mt-4 text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
          <p class="mb-3">
            It depends on the tier:
          </p>
          <ul class="list-disc list-inside space-y-2 ml-4 text-gray-700">
            <li><strong>Starter:</strong> You implement yourself with our templates (1-2 weeks)</li>
            <li><strong>Professional:</strong> We architect and train your team (2-4 weeks)</li>
            <li><strong>Enterprise:</strong> Full implementation with all standards (4-8 weeks)</li>
          </ul>
          <p class="mt-3">
            The system improves continuously after launch as knowledge compounds.
          </p>
        </div>

      <!-- Question 5 -->
      <details class="bg-white border-2 border-gray-200 rounded-lg p-6 cursor-pointer hover:border-blue-500 transition-all shadow-sm hover:shadow-md">
        <summary class="text-xl font-semibold text-gray-900 cursor-pointer">
          Do I need technical skills to use KTC?
        </summary>
        <div class="mt-4 text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
          <p class="mb-3">
            No. KTC is designed for knowledge workers, not developers.
          </p>
          <p>
            You interact with Brains through natural conversation. The methodology focuses on how to 
            structure knowledge, not on coding. If you can use ChatGPT, you can use KTC.
          </p>

            <li>Better knowledge retention (nothing gets lost between sessions)</li>
            <li>Improved team collaboration (shared knowledge across Brains)</li>
            <li>Compounding returns (system gets smarter over time)</li>

        <div class="mt-4 text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
          <p class="mb-3">
            Yes. KTC systems use enterprise-grade AI platforms (like Claude by Anthropic) with strong 
            privacy and security measures.
          </p>
          <p>
            Your Brains and their knowledge are private to your organization. We teach methodology 
            and help you implement—you own and control all data.

            Yes. KTC is methodology-agnostic and works across industries:

            <li>Legal practices (case precedents, client history, research)</li>
            <li>Product teams (feature decisions, user research, roadmaps)</li>
          </ul>
          <p class="mt-3">
            Any knowledge work where context and memory matter benefits from KTC.
