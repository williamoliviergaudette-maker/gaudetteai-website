      <h2 class="text-3xl font-bold mb-6 text-gray-900">The Problem</h2>
      <p class="text-lg text-gray-700 mb-4 leading-relaxed">
        Every AI conversation starts from zero. Context disappears between sessions. 
        Knowledge gets lost. You repeat yourself constantly.
      </p>
      <p class="text-lg text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
        It's like having a brilliant colleague who forgets everything overnight.

      <p class="text-lg text-gray-700 mb-4 leading-relaxed">
        Build systems where knowledge persists, compounds, and routes intelligently 
        across specialized AI "Brains."
