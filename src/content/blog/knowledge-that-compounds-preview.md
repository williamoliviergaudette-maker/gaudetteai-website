In February 2026, I'm publishing a book called *Knowledge That Compounds*.

This post is a preview of what's inside—and why I believe this methodology will change how knowledge workers approach AI.

## The Origin Story

In early January 2026, I hit the context loss wall hard.

I was using AI for everything—writing, research, planning, analysis. And I was spending more time re-explaining context than getting actual work done.

So I stopped. And I asked a different question:

**What would it take to build an AI system that actually remembers?**

Not a better memory feature. Not a longer context window. A fundamentally different architecture.

Two weeks later, I had a working system. Twelve specialized AI contexts ("Brains"), coordinated through eighteen documented standards, managing everything from book writing to financial tracking to client work.

And here's the meta-proof: **the book itself was written using the system it describes.**

50,000 words. Three days of focused writing. Because I wasn't starting from zero—I was building on weeks of accumulated knowledge.

## What KTC Actually Is

Knowledge That Compounds isn't a productivity hack. It's an architecture for human-AI collaboration.

The core insight: **AI without persistent memory is a brilliant colleague with amnesia.** Every conversation starts from zero. Knowledge evaporates. Nothing compounds.

The solution isn't to fix AI's memory. It's to build systems where **you** control how knowledge persists and connects.

KTC provides the framework for doing exactly that.

## The Five Principles

The methodology is built on five core principles:

### 1. Give AI Your Knowledge

Put your project-specific information where AI can access it continuously. Not summaries you reconstruct. Not context you re-explain. Persistent knowledge that AI reads every session.

### 2. Capture As You Go

Document decisions when you make them, not later. Ten minutes at the end of a session preserves context that would otherwise decay overnight.

### 3. Build Living Systems

Procedures that live in AI to be queried dynamically, not static documents that sit unread. Your systems evolve through use. They get better every time you work.

### 4. Distribute Intelligence

Knowledge flows to whoever needs it. Upward to managers who aggregate. Sideways to peers who collaborate. Multi-directional flows create network effects.

### 5. You Stay in Control

Human judgment at every step. AI suggests, you decide. AI filters, you verify. AI assists, you lead. The system amplifies your intelligence without replacing your authority.

## Who This Is For

KTC is for knowledge workers who:

- Use AI regularly and hit the context loss wall
- Want their AI work to compound over time
- Need systems that scale beyond personal use
- Value ownership and control over their knowledge

It's not for:
- Casual AI users who only need one-off tasks
- People looking for quick productivity hacks
- Anyone expecting AI to do the work for them

## What's in the Book

The book covers:

**Part 1: The Problem**
- Why context loss is universal
- The hidden costs of starting over
- Why memory features aren't enough

**Part 2: The Principles**
- Deep dive into each of the five principles
- How they work together
- Implementation patterns

**Part 3: The Architecture**
- Building your first "brain"
- Scaling to multiple specialized contexts
- Standards for coordination

**Part 4: Advanced Patterns**
- Knowledge harvest systems
- Cross-context routing
- Team implementations

## Coming February 2026

The book launches next month. If you want early access and updates on the methodology, [join the list](/books/knowledge-that-compounds).

This is just the beginning. The methodology works. The proof exists. Now it's time to share it.
